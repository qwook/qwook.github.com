            <h1>Hi, I'm Henry aka <b>Qwook</b></h1>

            <p>I'm a 19 year old <b>Software Engineer</b>,<br>
            and I do some web design on the side.</p>

            <p>I'm the programmer for an Augmented Reality College project

            <h1>Nontechnical Profile</h1>

            <p>I started Web Development by editing Neopets accounts and Myspace profile pages in elementary school.</p>
            <p>I love making video games as a hobby. In high school, I would always make video games in Game Maker with my friends.</p>
            <p>I have been working with computers since middle school. It has always fascinated me how they work. I used to take apart old video game consoles and controllers and play around with the circuitry to do different things -- this ended with me having a ton of broken controllers and computer parts in my garage.</p>
            <p>I love "Black Boxes" like Google. All you need to do is type in a phrase, and some sort of black magic wizardry would occur on the backend, and you would receive a magical listing of things relevant to what you're looking for. It's always interested me in how you could have something so simple, and yet so complex.</p>
            <p>I like listening to live music and going to music festivals and concerts. My favorite bands are The Killers and Two Door Cinema Club.</p>
