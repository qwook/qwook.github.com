    <h1>An introduction.</h1>
    <p>My name is Henry and I have been programming for as long as I’ve been on the computer.</p>

<p>I am interested in developing mobile and web applications, particularly applications involving computer vision and augmented reality.</p>

<p>I’ve done internships and hackathons involving front-end web design and web engineering for social media websites.</p>

<p>Though I have experience in mobile and web applications, I have a whole lot more experience in game design and game programming.</p>

<h2 id="i_love_making_video_games">I Love Making Video Games</h2>

<p>I was 9 when I first laid my eyes on my first video game. I was at the dentist’s office and the dentist had a Nintendo 64 set up with Mario Kart 64 already in it. I remember clearly all the music and bright colors it had. Since then, I have always wanted to make games.</p>

<p>I am able to create pixel art, digital paintings, 3D models, textures, and chiptune music.</p>

<p>It’s the sum total of every expressable medium of all times, made interactive.<br />[…]<br />It’s AWESOME.</p>

<p>This is one of the concept arts for a video game that I’m developing, called <em>Will and Henry’s Average Adventure</em>:</p>

<h2 id="i_love_concerts">I Love Concerts</h2>

<p>I’ve been to so many concerts, I can’t even count.</p>
