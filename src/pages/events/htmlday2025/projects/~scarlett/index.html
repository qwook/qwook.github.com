<p1><b>This... stuff’? Oh... okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you.

<br>You go to your closet and you select... I don’t know... that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back.</br>

<br>But what you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis. It’s actually cerulean.</br>

<br>You’re also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns.</br>

<br>And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent, wasn’t it, who showed cerulean military jackets?</br>

<br>I think we need a jacket here.</br>

<br>And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers.</br>

<br>And then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.</br>

<br>However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry,</br>

<br>when, in fact, you’re wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room... from a pile of stuff."</br></p1>
