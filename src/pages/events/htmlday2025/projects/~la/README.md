# HTML Day 2025 - "Find the Color" Game

This project was created for **HTML Day 2025**. The idea came about when I needed to focus on my coursework during the event. I asked Henry Tran if I could work on my assignments instead of presenting a web demo. He suggested I do something quick and simple, and said that just saying "I'm doing my coursework" would be fine.

Instead, I decided to spend 30 minutes coding a small game for people to waste time with. It ended up taking almost 2 hours!

## How It Works

- The page displays a grid of colored blocks on a canvas.
- One block is randomly chosen as the "winning color".
- The color of the winning block is shown as the background of the message at the top.
- Click on the canvas to try and find the block with the matching color.
- If you click the correct block, you win!
- Use the **Hint** button to reveal the winning block (all other blocks turn black).
- Use the **Reset** button to start a new game.

## Files

- [`index.html`](index.html): Main HTML file with Tailwind CSS and UI elements.
- [`script.js`](script.js): JavaScript logic for the game.

## Credits

- Idea and code by me, inspired by Henry Tran's advice.
- Made for HTML Day 2025.
