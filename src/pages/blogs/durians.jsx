        An elderly Vietnamese woman pushes a small metal cart full of groceries
        through the entryway of the train. The train is an empty yet incredibly
        loud function, due to a boy obnoxiously playing ClikClok videos on his
        phone's speakers. The elder's wheels get caught upon the yellow bumps
        jutting from the floor of the platform, and she jostles her carriage
        free. She has just spent the entire day's energy in a trek for her
        fruits, so she is too uncaring of the boy to hitch onto another car.
      </p>
      <p>
        She sits with her purse on her lap and her arms embracing the treasure
        in her cart; durian, dried prunes, and mangoes galore. Her head slumps
        and her eyelids droop down, her mind gravitating towards her grandson.
        The loud phone-speaker boy annoyingly raises his volume just because he
        can, but it does not deter her. She slowly drifts away. In four hours
        time, she will save the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You won't BELIEVE what happens–TAP–A day in the life of a s–TAP–This is
        my skincare routine–TAP–TAP–don't jiggle jig–TAP–Here's how to make the
        BEST fried squid, first take your knife and cut right through the—"
        SCREEEEEEECH!
      </p>
      <p>
        SMACK! A giant tentacle sears through the train car, slicing right
        between the Vietnamese grandma and the obnoxious teenager. The phone
        whistles right out of the boy's hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        "HOLY MOTHER OF R—" screams the boy as another tentacle rips through the
        metal from the other side and attempts to grab at him. SLAM!
      </p>
      <p>
        "TRỜI ĐẤT ỎI, CÁI GÌ VẬY?!" curses the half-awake grandma as she pushes
        her cart to the other side of the moving train and makes a jump away
        from the tentacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Sparks fly as a million teeth circularly
        grind like a Demonic table saw on the butt of the train. The end of the
        train is completely swallowed and exposed, and all that can be seen is
        an enormous tooth-spattered mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The slimy tentacle makes a successful grab at the boy, wrapping around
        his torso with an anaconda-like grip.
      </p>
      <p>The boy screams, "LADY! PLEASE! HELP!"</p>
      <p>
        The grandma grabs her metal cart and smashes it against the tentacle,
        but the beast thrashes the metal cart off the train. She dives toward
        the ground, then grabs and throws the mangos at the tentacles, each one
        cartoonishly bouncing off the beast. The tentacles draw the boy
        perilously close to the demon mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "CHẾT ĐI, MAI CON QUỶ!" she screams as she picks up a durian and, with
        perfect quarterback motion, flings it right into the mouth of the
        horror. Playing out in slow motion, the durian smoothly flies towards
        the throat and flicks the bulbous hanging thing in the back of the
        beast's mouth. Her eyes glimmer. The mouth closes up and the tentacles
        start violently vibrating and flailing, their grip on the boy weakening
        enough for him to slip free.
      </p>
      <p>SCREEEEEEEEECH! The train halts.</p>
      <p>
        Bing Bong. Daly City Train, this is a Daly City Station Bound Train.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boy and the grandma make a mad dash into the bustling Civic Center
        crowd, a frenzy of panicked ‘Friscans crashing through the exit doors.
        They find themselves in the twilight of San Franciscan streets.
        Surrounding them, a whirlwind of people run left and right with no
        concise heading.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That. Was. AMAZING!" yells the boy, still covered from his hoodie to
        his basketball sneakers in tentacle goop. "What WAS that? How did you DO
        that? What WAS it that you threw at that thing? Where are we? What was
        that thing? Are you a WIZARD? Oh my gosh, WHAT just happened!?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The grandma —not understanding a single word the boy said—reveals a
        durian, still unbruised, and stares deeply into it. A calm breeze passes
        as they both ponder the fruit, as if it were some magical orb.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calm is cut short by violent shaking, car alarms, and loud cement
        crackling. The eldritch horror emerges from beneath the city, revealing
        an incredible, dreadful, thousand-eyed face that only a thousand-eyed
        mother could love. A gargantuan kaiju with hundreds of tentacles of
        different sizes, all covered in luminescent slime. At the underbelly
        sits its circular, million-toothed mouth, now covered in its own acidic
        spew.
      </p>
      <p>
        "A biblically accurate angel . . ." said the
        uses-phone-speaker-in-public boy, mouth half-open from awe. "What are we
        going to do?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The durian-beholden grandma knows just what to do. She pulls out her
        cellphone, its text size set to 400 percent, and with a slow
        helicopter-finger, she diddles with the device and then puts it away.
        She points at one of those electric rental app scooters. "You want me .
        . . to ride the scooter?" She makes a gesture and pointed at herself.
        "You want us . . . to ride? At the same time?"
      </p>
      <p>
        We bring to you breaking news. It appears that a giant, multi-eyed
        monster has erupted right in the middle of San Francisco. The monster is
        wreaking havoc upon the city! It has so far destroyed four blocks, and,
        wait . . . What is that? In the midst of this . . . is . . . is that an
        elderly woman and a small boy riding on an electric scooter? At the same
        time? Isn't that against their app policy?
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's working, it's actually working!" The boy announces as he zips the
        scooter along the surrounding blocks. The elderly lady breaks apart the
        durian piece by piece and flings small chunks of it at the tentacles,
        forcing the tentacles to curl back as each durian piece gets absorbed
        through the monster's dermis. "Wait, what happens when we run out?"
      </p>
      <p>"Mahjong."</p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>
        "Mahjong." She repeats. As the scooter approaches Chinatown, she points
        at a group of ten elderly ladies, all with metal carts full of spiky
        fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ladies, colorfully dressed in Adidas tracksuits and transparent
        visors, all nod in sequence at the grandma. The grandma tosses a durian
        piece at the tentacles, showing off its repulsing nature toward the
        monster. They then run in perfect tai-chi choreography and throw durians
        at the tentacles, each one retracting at the fruit's touch. The monster
        rolls to its side, revealing its massive, thousand-toothed mouth,
        rotating circularly in its familiar buzzsaw fashion. They stare into the
        seemingly endless void of mouth like it is a death portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking their awe, the ladies throw all their durian left into the
        monsters mouth, each with perfect precision. The monster shakes and
        flails violently once more, spewing and twitching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now with most of its tentacles retracted, the beast spins its remainder
        at an incredibly fast speed until it makes a deafening helicopter sound.
        It flies away, leaving wreckage and slime in its wake. As it ascends, it
        bellows out in a deep voice, "THAANKKSS FOORR THEEE FOOODDD, IT TASTED
        GOOODDD."
      </p>
      <p>"Wait . . . what?" the boy says.</p>
      <p>
        The sun sets upon the city of San Francisco. Police and sunglassed
        black-suits cover the area in yellow tape, assessing and recording the
        damage. The boy and the durian-painted ladies sit in front of the ruin
        and destruction. They share in the tasty joys of durian, and watch
        ClikClok videos together. They all smile at each other and exchange
        laughter. All is sort of right with the world, or at least with San
        Francisco.
