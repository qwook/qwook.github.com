        I don't consider myself an intellectual. I think I'm a really dumb
        person who, for some reason, can code.
      </p>

        I never felt pressure from my parents to perform well academically. I
        felt that pressure from my peers, which all were going to UC's and Ivy
        leagues. I scored a 1600 on my SAT test (1060 in today's scoring),
        whereas my peers were scoring around the 2300 area (1520 in today's
        scoring).

        I had a lot of trouble focusing and taking in anything in a class
        setting. I cheated a lot in my classes. My parents enrolled me in a few
        after-school tutoring classes and I was a menace. I called things stupid
        and lashed out at the tutors. I thought it was a waste of time.
      </p>

        I think it was because it took me away from the things I cared about
        more. <a href="/archive">I taught myself how to program in elementary school.</a> I stumbled
        into game modding and game development communities where I wrote my
        first lines of C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        In class I doodled game ideas and daydreamed about new game mechanics I
        wanted to explore. I was interested in computer science but I didn't
        know what "computer science" was, and my high school didn't offer it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated high school with around a 2.6 GPA, just above the threshold
        to get accepted as an undeclared major in San Jose State. At the time, I
        was thinking of joining the Animation Illustration program.
      </p>

        San Jose State University was not a great school for education by far.
        Overcrowded classes, professors reading verbatim off slides, professors
        yelling violently at students, some classes just had you playing a video
        of a pre-recorded lecture from Stanford.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did absolutely love the electives I took and the clubs I joined. I
        played experimental and indie music on our college radio station. I also
        joined our school's Game Dev Club which pushed me further into a
        subculture I found a lot of enjoyment out of. There was a teacher that
        taught an Artificial Intelligence course that was a front for creative
        coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        My friends in college were from a huge range of people, from Japanese
        exchange students, to skaters, to Vietnamese ravers, to local punk
        bands. Aside from a year where I lead the UI team on the robotics club,
        I rarely hung out with other engineers or CS students. Except for my
        best friend who was both a skater and a programmer. I think because San
        Jose State University had a lower bar, it attracted a rich range of the
        most unique people, most of which just didn't really care too much about
        school and were really chill.
      </p>

        I was a D student in high school and had to cheat, but now I was the top
        performing student, which was weird. I skipped almost all my Computer
        Science classes and still passed. I remember finishing my final 30
        minutes early and everyone staring at me. Another student accused me of
        taking drugs to boost my performance, which I was offended by. I did
        smoke a lot of weed though, which arguably has lowered my IQ. I also
        hacked the computer science department's assignment submission portal,
        because the program used to test the submissions was not sandboxed.
      </p>
      <p>
        San Jose State University was overall a 3.5/5 stars for me. I was
        depressed most of the time, but I also had some of the best and most
        unique experiences in my life. People were great. Clubs were great.
        Academics could be better.
