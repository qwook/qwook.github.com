# Henry's Personal Home Page

Developing: `npm run start`

Building: `npm run build`

Known issues:

- When adding a new .jsx under pages, you will need to restart the webpack
  server.

# TODO:

I need to generate the page metadata as part of the initial static website for
it to show up on scrapers and media previews.
