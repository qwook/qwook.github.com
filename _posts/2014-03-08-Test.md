title: An introduction.

My name is Henry and I have been programming for as long as I've been on the computer.

I am interested in developing mobile and web applications, particularly applications involving computer vision and augmented reality.

I've done internships and hackathons involving front-end web design and web engineering for social media websites.

Though I have experience in mobile and web applications, I have a whole lot more experience in game design and game programming.

I Love Making Video Games
-------------------------

I was 9 when I first laid my eyes on my first video game. I was at the dentist's office and the dentist had a Nintendo 64 set up with Mario Kart 64 already in it. I remember clearly all the music and bright colors it had. Since then, I have always wanted to make games.

I am able to create pixel art, digital paintings, 3D models, textures, and chiptune music.

This is one of the concept arts for a video game that I'm developing, called *Will and Henry's Average Adventure*:
