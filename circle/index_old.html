		<h1>The Circle - Post-Mortem</h1>
		<p>The Circle was an interactive theatrical production of the Dave Egger's book of the same name. The production took place at San Jose State University on November 18th–21st, 2015.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Circle-Dave-Eggers/dp/0345807294">The Circle</a> is a book about a girl named Mae joining a Facebook-esque company called <em>The Circle</em>. While working at The Circle, Mae discovers that the truth about The Circle's reach over the world seems about as close to a dystopian future. The book emphasizes on how social media and impending technological advances might have an adverse effect on our lives in the near future.</p>
			<p>To enhance the message of the book, <em>The Circle at SJSU</em> made an effort to combine technology and theater by pushing useage of live-streaming, iBeacon technology, and smartphones. The production also made a big effort to turn the experience into a real-world Role Playing Game.</p>
			<p>My friend <a href="http://wsimons.com/">Will Simons</a> and I worked on developing the iOS and Android app for The Circle, which proved to be a lot of work.</p>
			<h2>From the Top</h2>
			<p>In August 2015, Will and I were contacted by <a href="https://rubaiyat.wordpress.com">James Morgan</a>, advisor for the Game Dev Club at SJSU, about working on an <em>exciting interactive theatrical project</em> called <em>The Circle</em>. By Jame's reference, we were able to meet up with Josh, the director for The Circle, to talk about what the play was and how we would go about working on the play.</p>
			<p>Josh told us that he wanted the play to have a companion smartphone app, and emphasized largely on the app's useage of iBeacons and how it would track the user's location to enhance the experience of the play. We thought the idea was amazing and agreed to develop the app.</p>
			<p>To give us advice and knowledge, we were joined by <a href="http://dustinfreeman.org/">Dustin Freeman</a>. Dustin had previously worked on an art display project utilizing iBeacons.</p>
			<p>We were also joined by other people from the Game Development club who would work on gamifying the experience. They determined how users would score points (or if they were to score points at all), how events would work and how users would interact with the actors.</p>
			<div class="media"><img src="./screen2.png"><div class="description">Gamifying the App</div></div>
			<p>Before this app, Will and I have had close to no experience with mobile app development. We've done web development before, which is only a little bit similar to app development. In fact, Will had never created anything that was going to be on as large of a scale as The Circle. In my prior experience, I've been able to deploy games on my iPhone but only through third party languages that have wrappers for iOS (Unity and LÖVE 2D). I've never actually created a full-blown app before.</p>
			<h2>Choosing the Tech</h2>
			<p>So, given that both of us were Web Developers, with almost no experience in iOS or Android development, we decided to choose a framework that we were already familiar with.</p>
			<p>Initially, we built a </p>
			<h2>Ideas, Ideas, Ideas!</h2>
			<p>We had so many ideas for what the app could be and what we could do for the app!</p>
			<p>We wanted a <em>dumb</em> event scripting language that the stage manager or director or anybody could edit in a drag and drop interface that allowed them to play around with the events that could occur.</p>
			<h2>3 Midterms Later...</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Then There Was Light</h2>
			<h2>In the Shark Tank</h2>
			<h2>Aftermath</h2>
			<p>There were high hopes for this project, and a lot of things that we wanted to do had to be thrown out in order to ship the app on time.</p>
			<p>The play itself had some faults and at times were confusing. People got lost and didn't know where to go.</p>
			<p>Regardless of the faults, it was pretty much the first of it's kind, and it was pretty damn entertaining when it all came together. I thoroughly enjoyed developing for this project and I hope to be involved in my projects like this in the future.</p>
			<p>I think the use of iBeacon technology will some day find it's place in theatre, and interactive entertainment like The Circle will be more prevalent. This is merely just the first step for the world of technologically-enhanced interactive theater, and it stumbled a little but it will learn how to walk eventually.</p>
